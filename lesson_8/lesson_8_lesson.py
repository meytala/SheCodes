# While .items() returns an array of tuples with each tuple consisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary:
#    A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists.
#    The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets

# The .keys() method returns a list of the dictionary's keys, and
# The .values() method returns a list of the dictionary's values.
